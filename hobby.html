                <p>Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.Like many other people in India I was also aspired to play for my country. My days were never complete without cricket I used to play with my friends after my school hours were over. I use my left hand to hold the bat and bowl the ball which many people found strange but I was comfortable playing. Later with time I learnt to play cricket well and started participating in my school teams. I was appreciated by the match viewers as I used to be the highest score holder of the match. </p>
